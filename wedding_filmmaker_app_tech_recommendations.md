   - **Best for:** Projects requiring older browser support or simpler DOM manipulation

### Implementation Recommendation:
For the wedding filmmaker project management app, **Vue.js** or **Alpine.js** would be the most suitable options due to their lightweight nature, ease of implementation, and good browser compatibility.

## 2. JavaScript Charting Libraries for Percentage Visualization

### Top Recommendations:

1. **Chart.js**
   - **Highlights:** Lightweight and easy to implement with clean designs
   - **Pros for Wedding App:** Simple API, responsive charts, good for percentage visualizations
   - **Best for:** Clean, simple progress tracking and percentage displays

2. **ApexCharts**
   - **Highlights:** Flexible and modern with interactive displays
   - **Pros for Wedding App:** Good for progress bars and percentage tracking
   - **Best for:** More interactive and dynamic visualizations

3. **Highcharts**
   - **Highlights:** Highly configurable with enterprise-level support
   - **Pros for Wedding App:** Detailed percentage tracking capabilities
   - **Best for:** More complex visualization requirements

4. **Plotly.js**
   - **Highlights:** Scientific charting library with multiple chart types
   - **Pros for Wedding App:** Good for complex data representations
   - **Best for:** Advanced data visualization needs

5. **D3.js**
   - **Highlights:** Powerful and highly customizable
   - **Pros for Wedding App:** Complete control over visualizations
   - **Best for:** Custom, unique visualization requirements (but has steeper learning curve)

### Implementation Recommendation:
For the wedding filmmaker project management app, **Chart.js** would be the most suitable option due to its lightweight nature, ease of implementation, and clean visualization style for percentage completion tracking.

## 3. Data Persistence Options

### Top Recommendations:

1. **localStorage**
   - **Highlights:** Simple to implement, persists after browser closes
   - **Pros for Wedding App:** Easy to use for storing user preferences and app state
   - **Best for:** Storing small amounts of data (up to 5MB per domain)

2. **IndexedDB**
   - **Highlights:** More powerful client-side database
   - **Pros for Wedding App:** Good for storing larger amounts of structured data
   - **Best for:** More complex data storage needs

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - **Highlights:** Combine client-side storage with lightweight server-side options
   - **Pros for Wedding App:** Flexibility for different types of data
   - **Best for:** Applications requiring both online and offline functionality

### Implementation Recommendation:
For the wedding filmmaker project management app, **localStorage** would be sufficient for basic data persistence needs, with the option to upgrade to **IndexedDB** if more complex data storage is required.

## 4. Visual Examples

### Chart.js Percentage Visualization
Chart.js offers clean, simple visualizations for percentage tracking, including pie charts and progress indicators that would work well for project completion tracking.

### ApexCharts Progress Visualization
ApexCharts provides more interactive and dynamic visualizations, including radial progress bars that could effectively display project completion percentages.

## 5. Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Approach:
1. Use **Vue.js** as the primary framework for building the user interface
2. Implement **Chart.js** for percentage completion visualization
3. Utilize **localStorage** for client-side data persistence
4. Ensure responsive design for cross-device compatibility

### Development Steps:
1. Set up a basic Vue.js project structure
2. Implement core functionality for project management
3. Add Chart.js for visualization components
4. Implement localStorage for saving project data
5. Test across multiple browsers and devices

## 6. Conclusion

The combination of Vue.js, Chart.js, and localStorage provides the optimal balance of lightweight implementation, ease of use, and functionality for the wedding filmmaker project management application. This stack will allow for quick development while ensuring good performance and user experience.
